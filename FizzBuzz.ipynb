    "**Fizz buzz** is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Someone chosen by lot starts counting from $1$ then players take turns incerementing a previous number and saying the result except on occasion it should be replaced by\n",
    "* *Fizz* if the result is divisible by $3$,\n",
    "* *Buzz* if the result is divisible by $5$,\n",
    "* *Fizz Buzz* if both occur simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wrong answer means the player is out of a game continued round by round. Eventually there would be a word chain likes \"One, Two, *Fizz*, Four, *Buzz*, *Fizz*, Seven, Eight, ...\" and a winner who never made a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FizzBuzz** is also a common programming task to test basic skills. In this case a sequence from $1$ to $100$ should be a program output and could be obtained in many ways. That is why there are a lot of its implementation in different programming languages. Here we realize a simplified version of FizzBuzz in Qiskit using Grover's Search Algorithm (GSA) for multiple solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual goal is to create a FizzBuzz sequence from $0$ to $15$ due to some reasons. All the numbers have a four bit representation, two auxiliary bits are enough to carry a result of check condition that is simplified in the range, and there are two FizzBuzz opening and closing the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical approaches are generally based on for loop which body contains a divisibility test. A number of iterations $N$ then equals to length of input and time complexity is linear $O\\left(N\\right)$. Actually it may vary slightly because a database is not a complitely unstructured. Meanwhile quantum computing looks promising to improve significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "GSA is an unstructured search algorithm presented by Lov Grover in 1996. Instead of brutforce it processes all data in parallel increasing a probability of favorable outcomes in final distribution. To find $k$ solutions in array of $N$ elements we perform $\\lfloor\\frac\\pi4\\sqrt\\frac N K\\rfloor$ iterations thus time complexity correponds to square root $O\\left(\\sqrt N\\right)$. This is quadratic speedup that is why GSA provides quantum supremacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We break down the task into *Fizz* and *Buzz* parts using two divisibility tests independent of one another. Nevertheless both return very similar results. To avoid any confusion we create two quantum circuits differ in divisibility test but have an oracle and a diffuser the same. At the end their measurement results will be processed together to create an output. There are six multiples of $3$ which are $\\{ 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\\}$ and four multiples of $5$ which are $\\{ 0, 5, 10, 15\\}$ thus the oracle is applied $\\lfloor\\frac\\pi4\\sqrt\\frac{16}6\\rfloor=1$ time in *Fizz* and $\\lfloor\\frac\\pi4\\sqrt\\frac{16}4\\rfloor=1$ time in *Buzz* circuits. On the whole we call the oracle twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number doesn't depend on input length. Indeed each third number is divisible by $3$ so $\\frac Nk\\approx3$ and each fifth number is divisible by $5$ so $\\frac Nk\\approx5$. It gives $\\lfloor\\frac\\pi4\\sqrt3\\rfloor=1$ iteration for *Fizz* and $\\lfloor\\frac\\pi4\\sqrt5\\rfloor=1$ iteration for *Buzz*. As a result we have constant time complexity $O\\left(2\\right)$ conditioned by some input structure."
