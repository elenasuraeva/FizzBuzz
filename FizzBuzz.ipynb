    "**Fizz buzz** is a group word game for children to teach them about division [1]. Someone chosen by lot starts counting from $1$ then each next player takes turns incerementing a previous number and saying the result except on occasion it should be replaced by\n",
    "* *Fizz* if the result is divisible by $3$,\n",
    "* *Buzz* if the result is divisible by $5$,\n",
    "* *Fizz Buzz* if both occur simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wrong answer means the player is out of the game continued round by round. As a result there are a word chain likes \"One, Two, *Fizz*, Four, *Buzz*, *Fizz*, Seven, Eight, ...\" and a winner who had no mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FizzBuzz** is also a common programming task to test basic skills. In this case a sequence from $1$ to $100$ should be a program output and could be obtained in many ways. So there are a lot of its implementations in different programming languages. Let's try to realize a simplified version of FizzBuzz in Qiskit using Grover's Search Algorithm (GSA) for multiple solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a FizzBuzz sequence from $0$ to $15$ due to some reasons. All the numbers have a four bit representation, two auxiliary bits are enough to carry a condition check that is simplified in the range, and there are two FizzBuzz opening and closing the chain. Consider a binary string $$c_5c_4c_3c_2c_1c_0$$ where two most significant bits $c_5c_4$ keep some information about a number encoded in four least significant bits $c_3c_2c_1c_0$. Classical approaches are generally based on for-loop which body contains a divisibility test therefore the number of iterations $N$ equals to amount of elements. It corresponds to a linear time complexity $O\\left(N\\right)$ and may vary slightly for some implementations meanwhile quantum computing looks promising to improve that.\n",
    "\n",
    "GSA is an unstructured search algorithm presented by Lov Grover in 1996 [2]. Instead of serial brute force it processes all data in parallel increasing a probability of desired outcomes in final distribution. Create a quantum circuit and perform $N=\\frac\\pi4\\sqrt\\frac N K$ iterations giving square root time complexity $O\\left(\\sqrt N\\right)$. That means quadratic speedup so GSA provides quantum supremacy.\n",

    "It is required only 6 qubits that is not be splitted into main and ancillary registers in a code but can be mentioned this way in description. "
